# Russet

**Russet** is a single-player, terminal-based implementation of the *SET* card game, written in Rust.
I really love the game but haven't found a great way to play it when I don't have the cards on-hand; I also love Rust and want a lot more practice with it. This project is my solution to both problems!

It should be able to run on any terminal emulator supported by the [crossterm crate](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm).

Cards can be selected by clicking on them or pressing the corresponding keys from the QWERTY, ASDFGH, and ZXCVBN rows.

Functionality is limited currently, check back soon!
