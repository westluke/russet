1. In particular find a graceful way to inform user when they increase font size enough that printing goes out of bounds

2. Score

3. Animation
idea: when new set slides in to replace old one, we pick random pixels from the old last found set and start resetting them, to achieve a disintegrating effect

5. Configuration

7. Menu

8. Restarting



GameState is doing way too much and its signatures aren't unified. fix it. How? internal recordinig mechanism?
printing that fast is causing blackscreen issues. how could i deal with that?
maybe sleep a minimum amount after each print? but I'm already doing that... its probably my basttery level rn.

gettting around slow screen update - the impl Write argument should be my custom buffer, that records where things have been written.
"clear" doesn't actually clear it?

it records changes, and only prints when necessary:

wait im not using a buf right now lol. ok try taht first
well that helps a lot, but it doesn't fix everything

errors definitely not being handled properly when they propagate back up






FIX POS TO BE 0-BASED
FIX PRINTINIG TO USE SMARTBUF METHODS RATHER THAN STRINGS AND WRITE MACROS

making logging!
how to make logging tho... do i need it? Well, apparently, yeah. Cuz things are making the thread panic before it can reset the terminal...
or just do mroe graceful shutdown


//why is it slow to react to user input? hm. may want to do some profiling here.
Suspect that most of this time is just being spent in the printing chaiin? and then the flushing chain...
yeah, just measure the time spent between them with some logging.
